# Kotlin Generics & Coroutines Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Kotlin Generics** and **Kotlin Coroutines**, following best practices in **clean code** and **modular design**. It includes an example of generics, coroutine execution with delays, and the use of dispatchers for optimal performance.

## Task Breakdown
### 1. Kotlin Generics Implementation 
- I thoroughly read and analyzed the Medium article **"Kotlin Generics - The Ultimate Guide."**
- To demonstrate my understanding, I implemented a **custom example** of Kotlin Generics, different from those mentioned in the article.
- The implementation was done in **Kotlin Playground** and includes:
  - A generic class that operates on different data types.
  - A generic function demonstrating reusability and flexibility.
  - A sample main function showing the use of generics in real scenarios.

### 2. Kotlin Coroutines with Delays & Dispatchers 
- I implemented three functions using **Kotlin Coroutines**.
- These functions were executed in two ways:
  - **Sequential Execution**: Each function runs one after another with delays.
  - **Concurrent Execution**: All functions run at the same time using coroutines.
- I utilized **Dispatchers** for better execution control.
- Implemented proper **error handling** to catch exceptions in coroutines.
- The implementation was done in **Android Studio**.

### 3. Clean Code Principles 
- Ensured the code is **well-structured** and **modular**.
- Used meaningful function names for clarity.
- Managed coroutine scope properly to avoid memory leaks.

## How to Run the Project
### Running the Generics Example
1. Open [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/).
2. Copy and paste the generics code.
3. Run the code and observe the output.

### Running the Coroutines Example
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdallahLearn/W5D4_Gernric_Assignment.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Run the **MainActivity** file.
4. Observe the output in **Logcat**.
